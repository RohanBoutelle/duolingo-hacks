DISCLAIMER:
THESE DUOLINGO HACKS WERE NOT WRITTEN BY ME AND I FOUND THEM ON GREASYFORK.ORG. I AM JUST MAKING A LIST OF THE BEST ONES THAT I HAVE USED. SO PLEASE DO NOT COMMENT SAYING THAT I STOLE THIS CODE ETC. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
To use any of these hacks all you have to do is go to duolingo.com and open the lesson you want to. Then right click on the screen, after that select inspect element. Then click on the console and paste the code in.

NOTE:

Also I only tested this in Google Chrome so I do not know if it will work in other browsers. And if you do it in another browser then my instructions probably will not work.
